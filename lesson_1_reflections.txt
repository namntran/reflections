How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Automatic tools make comparison betwen 2 files less tedious, highlighted text with - and +, it would be impossible without diff command to compare thousands of lines of codes to spot a typo or other minor mistake.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

When code, program or website breaks it would be useful to go back to the previous version that was working before changes to identify the bug.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros: less files to compare when debugging code, ability to work offline
Cons: may lose time if lose critical code that hasn't been committed.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?



Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Version control, collaboration with other programmers, debugging
