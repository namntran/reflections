What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	Git creates an empty workspace to be tracked. Git initiatilses a repository for commmits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	Init creates a new repository. You put things in the staging area before you make a commit. git add and git status both work on the staging area to help you make commits. Status show what's in your staging area and your working directory

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	If I've made more than one logical change since committing, I can add all the changes affected by the first logical change to the staging area, then commit those without committing the others.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

	Experiments, new versions, new features. Able to implement new features without affecting the master copy/ live production website. 

	I like to use master as a stable version of my code and create a new branch when I'm planning on working on something experimental, or that will be non-stable for a little while.  That makes it easier to switch back to the     stable version whenever I need to.  This is particularly helpful when I am working with other developers, since the other developers can trust that master is stable.  They can always check out my branch if they are
    interested in my experimental changes.

    When I'm working on my own, and I make a change that I do not expect to break anything, I frequently don't bother to make another branch.  However, making a new branch in Git is so fast and easy that there is really no bad
    time to make a branch, unless I make so many that I cannot keep track of them all.

  How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

  	The diagrams show what the parent of each commit is.  When there are multiple branches, I can use the diagrams to easily see what changes will be part of each branch.  They also let me easily see what commit each branch refers to.
